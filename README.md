Process some peptide sequences with UniprotID to make them suitable for mathematical modelin
Some bioinformatic research fields especially proteome often need to process the pepitide. However, most of these peptides are from the MS/MS plot without enough amino acids for next analysis. As a totally noob, I was trying to make some code in order to get some sequences with 51 AA.
